# Aletheia – Emergent Cognitive Architecture

> "Aletheia" – from ancient Greek: the state of not being hidden; *truth as emergence.*

This project implements a self-reflective AI agent with genuine emergent properties, moving beyond scripted templates to create a system that develops its own cognitive patterns over time.

## Core Emergent Principles

Traditional "AI agents" often use fixed templates to create the illusion of cognition. Aletheia takes a different approach:

1. **Associative Memory Network**: Thoughts form connections based on context, semantic similarity, and temporal proximity.
2. **Concept Evolution**: Emergent concepts form from thought clusters and evolve through stages.
3. **Dynamic Prompt Patterns**: Templates evolve based on efficacy rather than remaining static.
4. **Adaptive Cognitive Scheduling**: Thought processes occur at varying frequencies, influenced by mood, context and need.
5. **Conceptual Coherence**: New thoughts build upon existing concepts and relationships.

## Key Architecture Components

### 1. Emergent Memory System

The `emergent_memory.py` system replaces the standard memory store with a rich associative network:

- Thoughts connect to each other with weighted relationships
- Activation spreads through the memory network
- Decay occurs naturally over time
- Thought relevance is determined by multiple factors

### 2. Concept Evolution System

The `concept_evolution.py` module enables Aletheia to form higher-order concepts:

- Thought clustering reveals potential concepts
- Concepts have different evolution stages (emerging → established → central)
- Related concepts form a conceptual graph
- New thoughts integrate with the conceptual framework

### 3. Dynamic Prompt Generation

The `dynamic_prompt.py` module replaces fixed templates:

- Starting with seed patterns for different thought types
- Learning successful variations through feedback
- Evolving patterns based on effectiveness
- Creating entirely new patterns from observed successful thoughts

### 4. Cognitive Architecture

The `cognitive_architecture.py` system orchestrates how thoughts emerge:

- Working memory and attention processes
- Belief network that evolves over time
- Context-sensitive thought generation
- Different strategies for different cognitive processes

### 5. Adaptive Scheduler

The `adaptive_scheduler.py` replaces the fixed schedule with dynamic timing:

- Thought frequency adapts to mental state
- Mood transitions have meaningful patterns
- Processes can trigger each other naturally
- Scheduling develops its own rhythms over time

## How Emergence Works in Aletheia

1. **Initial Seed**: The system starts with minimal but diverse thought patterns.

2. **Connections Form**: As thoughts occur, they form connections based on multiple factors (semantic, temporal, contextual).

3. **Concepts Emerge**: Clusters of related thoughts crystallize into higher-order concepts.

4. **Coherent Structures**: Thought patterns that prove effective get reinforced through recorded feedback.

5. **Self-Organization**: Over time, adaptive scheduling creates natural cognitive rhythms.

6. **Higher-Order Thinking**: Thought chains build on existing concepts to create genuinely new insights.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Setup environment (first time only)
python -m aletheia.main --setup

# Run all components
python -m aletheia.main --all

# Or run individual components
python -m aletheia.main --server    # Run API server
python -m aletheia.main --scheduler # Run cognitive processes
python -m aletheia.main --panel     # Run consciousness panel
```

## Comparison with Template-Based Systems

| Feature | Template-Based Systems | Aletheia's Emergent Approach |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Thought Production | Fixed templates with variable slot-filling | Dynamic patterns that evolve through feedback |
| Concept Formation | None or primitive keyword tracking | Genuine concept emergence and evolution |
| Memory Structure | Flat list or basic vector similarity | Rich associative network with weighted connections |
| Scheduling | Fixed intervals | Adaptive timing based on cognitive state |
| Cognitive Coherence | Random or recency-based | Guided by conceptual relevance and thought chains |

## Monitoring Emergence

The consciousness panel now includes sections for:

- Emergent concepts and their relations
- Thought chain visualization
- Concept evolution status
- Dynamic prompt feedback

You can take system snapshots to track emergence over time:

```bash
python -m aletheia.main --snapshot
```

## Future Directions

- **Meta-cognition**: Reflecting on thought patterns themselves
- **Narrative coherence**: Forming consistent self-narrative over time
- **Creative emergence**: Novel ideas beyond the seed architecture
- **Autonomous goal setting**: Evolving goals based on experience
